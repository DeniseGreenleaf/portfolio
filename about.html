          <p> Hi, this page will be about me as a person, if you are interested in my work and skillset you kan find it under projects and current project. A little summary can be found
            on the Home page and in my CV.<br>
            My name is Denise and I’m a nurse who is choosing a new path in life.
        I am a team player and a hard worker. I love programming and system development
        because there is always more to learn and you’re never fully taught, there is always
        a skill you can work on and improve. Below you will learn who I am and how I am as a colleague.

      <h3>Problem Solver</h3>
      <p>
        Here is a picture of me during my night shift as a nurse. All the patients were sleeping,
        so I decided to fix the copy machine that broke down for the millionth time. I'm a problem solver and 
        I enjoy making work easier for my coworkers. They all had their copies neatly prepared and ready in the morning.

      <p>
        I love taking on different projects and me and my partner often try to learn new things.  
        Here is a picture of me after finishing an 18 000 piece puzzle (sorry for the bad quality butit is 
        the only proof I have). The other pictures show me turning the apartment to a bike workhop fixing and painting
        our bikes. As you can see I am not afraid of challlenges and I've proven I am resilient and persistent in completing tasks. 
        bonus picture of me running a half marathon knee deep in the mud.

      <h3>Enjoying Life</h3>
      <p>
        I keep a professional attitude in the workplace and I believe it is important. 
        But it is just as important to let loose sometimes and have fun and have a positive attitude. I think I have found a good balance between 
        being professional and serious when needed while still having having fun, it makes teamwork easier in my opinion.<br>
         Here are some picures of me enjoying life. 
        The last two pictures tells the story of me river rafting in Uganda which tangled my hair so bad i had to rip/cut most of it off, but as you can see
        I didn't let that bring me down, I always wondered how i would look in a nice mustashe and now I know!<br>
        I’m not afraid of being silly or making a fool of myself and I think that helps me ask
        questions and share ideas without fear.

      <h3>Family</h3>
      <p>
        This is the love of my life, Per, he is the one who got me into programming. He is very supportive 
        in my journey to become a system developer and we are doing some programming projects together in our spare time.
        Together with our children Sam Vise (named after Samwise Gamgee) and Ingrid Luna
        (named after my grandmother and Luna Lovegood), we enjoy life and adventures.
        I have found myself writing code while soothing a fussy baby at the same time, proving I work well under stress and distractions while not losing track of the goal.
        My dream is to do this full time so I can see what I can accomplish giving it my full attention.

      <p> I think it is important to move your body and enjoy experiences to fill your cup and make you feel up to take on new challenges in life.
         Here is me in the deep jungle hanging with gorillas for a few hours, as you can see on my face it was a really cool experience!
